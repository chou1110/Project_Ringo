# Streamlit Strategy Evaluation Template

## Overview

This project provides a **Streamlit-based template** for evaluating strategies that change over time. It serves as a flexible tool that can be adapted for different scenarios, particularly for analyzing and visualizing simulated strategy performance. Since this is a template, all the data used are **simulated based on experience**, and various techniques are implemented to generate realistic data patterns.

## Features

- üìä **Long-Term Trend Analysis**

  - Displays the **monthly trend** of the average value of the given strategy.
  - Helps identify overall patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of strategy adjustments over time.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Short-Term Strategy Under Different Scenarios**

  - Provides example strategies for **weekdays vs. holidays**, demonstrating how different conditions may require distinct approaches.
  - Allows for scenario-based evaluation of strategic differences.

- üîÑ **Execution Comparison**

  - Compares the **planned strategy vs. real execution** to assess strategy performance.
  - Includes **key performance indicators (KPIs)** such as the rate describing how closely the strategy aligns with real actions.
  - Additionally, it provides recommended actions based on the comparison to improve strategic alignment and execution efficiency.

## Installation

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
